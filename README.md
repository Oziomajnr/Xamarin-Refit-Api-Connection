# Xamarin-Refit-Api-Connection
A simple Xamarin android application to demonstrate how to easily connect to an api endpoint using the Refit library.
This is the sample code to the [Csharp Corner tutorial on using REFIT](http://www.c-sharpcorner.com/article/connecting-to-an-api-endpoint-using-refit-library/)

**To Use**
**1.** Fork or clone the repository or open with Visual Studio. 
**2.** I have removed all the references to reduce the repo size, the .Net base libraries should be added at build time,
  you can add the **REFIT** library using Nugget Package Manager by running the command **Install-Package refit** .
  Here is a link to the [REFIT library](https://github.com/paulcbetts/refit)
